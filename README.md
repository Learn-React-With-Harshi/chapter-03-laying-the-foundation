## Class Summary `Chapter - 03 Laying the foundation` (01/01/2023)
`Chapter-03` started with revising the previous sessions and doubts raised in the previous sessions were addressed. Babel/Polyfills and their usage were explained. Scripts were written for starting and building the app. Steps to install a npm package were walked through. JSX vs React.createElement() vs Components were discussed in depth. It was a truely knowledge heavy session with lot of new jargons.

One line about this chapter : ` JSX is not html inside JS but html-like syntax inside js for cerating react element object`
