**** Igniting React App ****

First class - Created Basic React App 

Today, production ready React App - From scratch without using create react-app
 
to Ignite our app  - Bundler eg : vite,parcel,webpack

In create react-app, they use webpack bundler 

Bundler is package/module of javascript code 

to have a package in code -> we need Package Manager (eg : npm, yarn)

npm init -> create package.json -> initialise our repo with npm 
npm init -y -> to skip configuration

why npm ? 
helper packages -> React app is powered by a lot of packages for bundling, optimizing, minifying 
maven : java :: rnpm : react 

Parcel : 
npm install package-name -> to install a package named package-name  & node modules (helper functions )is created 

npm install -d package-name -> -D means dev dependency or --save-dev

package-lock.json is created and parcel code is updated in node modules 

parcel is in dev dependencies of package-lock  - parcel is needed in dev environment 
~ update for major version
^ automatic update for minor version
without anything - exact version

if update happens, package.json is updated but package-lock.json is not updated 

package-lock.json - dont ignore in git 
but put node modules in gitignofa-rotate-180

if i have package-lock.json -> i can regenerate node modules 

react cdn - not good way 
Good way -> in server thrugh node modules 

npm install react -> in global dependencies not dev dependencies 

npx parcel index.html -> Execute using npm with index.html as entry point -> Creates local server 

Parcel gives us this server

Error : React is defined because we removed cdn link. Instead of that, we have to use import since this time we are using node modules - npm

Error : Browser doesnot understand import -> we have to inform its modules, use type="module" in script tag

Warning : React DOM  -> createRoot is not found -> use  react-dom/client 

Live Server -> Auto refresh  -> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) 
-> Parcel does it for us using File Watcher Algorithm (written in c++)
Parcel.cache -> uses this space for doing all the HMR, minify and other stuffs 
dist folder -> minified code in dist 
npx parcel build index.html -> production ready build is created by parcel inside dist folder and has only 3 files : css, html and js file containing 
all the code including react code 

Parcel Functionalities :
1. minification (removing indentation),
2. image optimizations, 
3. compression(renaming variables), 
4. cleaning our code,
5. super fast build,
6. dev and prod builds, 
7. caching while development
8. works with older version of browsers
9. Https on dev as well npx parcel index.html --https 
10.Consistent Hashing Algorithm
11.zero config
12. Tree shaking - Removing unwanted code 


we should put .parcel-cache in gitignore -> anything which can be autogenerated in server can be put in gitignore 

Initial dev build -> longer time (500ms) -> for next build -> takes less time 5ms using caching

When using parcel, we give entry point in command so we can remove main: app.js from package.json 


Transitive dependencies -> dependencies of dependencies Eg: Our App is dependent on Parcel which is again dependent on other dependencies (dependency Tree)

browsersList -> cross browser compatibility for older versions of browsers 

Summary Steps : 
1. npm init 
2. npm install -D parcel 
3. npm install react 
4. npm install react-dom
5. npx parcel index.html or npx parcel build index.html
6. import React from 'react'; in App.js
7. import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; in App.js 
8. use type="module" for index.html
9. Remove main : app.js from package.json
10. Write browserslist in package.json 

"browsersList" : [ "last 2 versions"]

Homework : 
1. Read Parcel Documentation 
2. Types of script in script tage in html
